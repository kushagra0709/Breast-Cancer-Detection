# Breast-Cancer-Detection

In this project, I have built a logistic regression model using Scikit-learn to classify breast cancer as either Malignant or Benign. The Breast Cancer Wisconsin (Diagnostic) Data Set from Kaggle has been used for this purpose. I have used a simple logistic regression classifier for cancer classification.
